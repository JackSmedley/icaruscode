@mainpage The ICARUS detector simulation and reconstruction software: `icaruscode` reference manual

This is the documentation of the ICARUS detector simulation and reconstruction
software, distributed in the main GIT repository `icaruscode`.

This software is powered by the @ref LArSoft "LArSoft toolkit", which has its

ICARUS documentation is scattered in places:

  offers guidelines, documents procedures, and much more; it tends to go outdated though;
- [SBN DocDB][SBNDocDB] (https://sbn-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/sso/DocumentDatabase)
  contains plenty of information
- reference manual (this one; [all versions: here][ICARUSDoxygenList]; [latest: here][ICARUSDoxygenLatest]) is a
  reference guide for the use of specific ICARUS code objects.
